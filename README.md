Librarian Aquarium
=================

This is a fork of a friend's [aquarium project](https://github.com/DigitalLibrarian/VS2010Projects/tree/master/Projects/Aquarium).
I've updated it so that it can be built in Visual Studio 2013 as a MonoGame Windows project instead of the now defunct XNA framework.
I had to remove the debug terminal functionality as the terminal was included in the project as a .dll built against the Microsoft binary.
I have requested the source code for the XNA 4 version from the author because the person was only distributing source code for version 3 of XNA.
I will re-add the terminal functions if I can rebuild the terminal against MonoGame.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, direct them to the [DigitalLibrarian](https://github.com/DigitalLibrarian)!
